#@# Swagger Documentation #@# - Used to feed @Swagger annotations
swagger.docs.xPress.operation.xLeas = xLea is a composite object that provides core information about a Local Educuation Agency (e.g. district, division, intermediate agency)
swagger.docs.xPress.operation.xSchools = xSchool is a composite object that provides essential information about a school building or campus
swagger.docs.xPress.operation.xCalendars = xCalendar is a composite object that provides information about sessions held at a particular school during a given school year
swagger.docs.xPress.operation.xCourses = xCourse is a composite object that provides essential information about a course
swagger.docs.xPress.operation.xRosters = xRoster is a composite object that provides a consolidated view of information related to a course section or class, including student enrollment and assigned staff
swagger.docs.xPress.operation.xStaffs = xStaff is a composite object that provides a view of the most commonly used core data elements for teachers and non-teaching staff
swagger.docs.xPress.operation.xStudents = xStudent is a composite object that provides a view of the most commonly used core data elements for students, and references to important associated objects like contacts
swagger.docs.xPress.operation.xContacts = xContact is a composite object that provides a view of the most commonly used core data elements for student contacts, and references to important associated objects like students
swagger.docs.oneroster.operation.academicSession=AcademicSession represent durations of time. Typically they are used to describe terms, grading periods, and other durations e.g. school years. Term is used to describe a period of time during which learning will take place. Other words for term could be in common use around the world e.g. Semester. The important thing is that Term is a unit of time, often many weeks long, into which classes are scheduled. Grading Period is used to represent another unit of time, that within which line items are assessed. A term may have many grading periods, a grading period belongs to a single term. A class may be assessed over several grade periods (represented by a line item being connected to a grading period). The parent / child attributes of academic sessions allow terms to be connected to their grading periods and vice-versa.
swagger.docs.oneroster.operation.class=A class is an instance of a course, onto which students and teachers are enrolled. A class is typically held within a term.
swagger.docs.oneroster.operation.course=A Course is a course of study that, typically, has a shared curriculum although it may be taught to different students by different teachers. It is likely that several classes of a single course may be taught in a term. For example, a school runs Grade 9 English in the spring term. There are four classes, each with a different 30 students, taught by 4 different teachers. However the curriculum for each of those four classes is the same - the course curriculum.
swagger.docs.oneroster.operation.demographic=The 'sourcedId' of the demographics MUST be the same as the 'sourcedId' of the user to which it refers
swagger.docs.oneroster.operation.enrollment=An enrollment is the name given to an individual taking part in a course or class. In the vast majority of cases, users will be students learning in a class, or teachers teaching the class. Other roles are also possible.
swagger.docs.oneroster.operation.org=Org is defined here as a structure for holding organizational information. An Org might be a school, or it might be a local, statewide, or national entity. Orgs will typically have a parent Org (up to the national level), and children, allowing a hierarchy to be established.
swagger.docs.oneroster.operation.user=Users, Teachers and Students are human beings that are teaching or studying in a class respectively. \n\n Humans may have relationships with other humans. For example, a student may have parents. The "agents" attribute allows for relationships between humans to be expressed. Note that these are typically from the point of view of the student - so a student will link to its parents (via the agent attribute). The reverse view MUST also be modeled, so for example, a user of role "parent" MUST have agents that are of type "student".
